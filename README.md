# Fine-Tuned BERT for Sentimental Analysis in kannada
the above project shows a simple way of finetuning a BERT model for sentiment analysis  
in the following project the BERT model has been fine tuned for sentiment analysis of kannada reviews 

# The dataset used has been refered from ai4bharat/IndicSentiment repository
from where the kannada reviews and the sentiment labels are extracted and used in the project

# The project also demonstrates the practical use of the Trained BERT model
by integrating the Trained BERT model with a user interface where one can analyze the sentiment of a single review or a batch of reivews can be analyzed by providing txt file containing each review line by line

# Run the project
to run th eproject 
  1. run the train.ipynb file which may take up to 1:30 to 2:00 hours depending on the computer hardware
  2. open the entire project folder in a code editor and then using terminal navigate to the folder where app1.py is saved
  3. run th app1.py by typing command **python app1.py**
  4. open the chrome and paste the local server link that appears after running the app1.py file
